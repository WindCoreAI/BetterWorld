## Overview

This roadmap covers 8 months of development across 4 phases, taking BetterWorld from documentation to a scaled platform with paying partners. Version 2.0 incorporates findings from the systematic documentation review (see `REVIEW-AND-TECH-CHALLENGES.md`) which identified 6 critical design decisions, 7 core technical challenges, and several budget/timeline corrections.

```
Sprint 0: Design Decisions         Week 0 (pre-dev)  Resolve ambiguities before code
Phase 1: Foundation MVP            Weeks 1-8         Agent-centric platform
Phase 2: Human-in-the-Loop        Weeks 9-16        Full pipeline with humans
Phase 3: Scale & Ecosystem        Weeks 17-24       Growth, partners, SDKs
Phase 4: Sustainability           Weeks 25-32       Revenue, governance, open-source
```

## Sprint 0: Design Decisions (Pre-Development, ~2 Days) — ✅ COMPLETE

These decisions block Sprint 1 implementation. Each must be resolved and documented before writing code.

| # | Decision | Options | Recommendation | Impact If Deferred |
|---|----------|---------|----------------|--------------------|
| 1 | **Embedding dimension** | 1024 (Voyage AI) vs 1536 (OpenAI) | **1024** — better quality/cost, 33% less storage | DB schema, all vector indexes, every embedding call — changing later means re-embedding all content |
| 2 | **Guardrail pipeline model** | Sync middleware (blocking) vs Async queue (BullMQ) | **Async queue** — returns 202 Accepted, content published on approval. Already designed in AI/ML doc | Cascades through entire API design, frontend state management, testing strategy |
| 3 | **Admin app architecture** | Separate `apps/admin/` vs route group in `apps/web/` | **Route group in `apps/web/`** for MVP. Split in Phase 3 if admin surface grows | Doubles frontend work if separate app chosen too early |
| 4 | **Agent verification fallback** | X/Twitter only vs multi-method | **Multi-method**: X/Twitter (preferred) + GitHub gist + email domain proof | Hard dependency on expensive, unreliable X/Twitter API |
| 5 | **Content state on submission** | Immediately visible vs "pending" state | **"Pending" state** — natural consequence of async guardrails. Content visible only after approval | UX and frontend architecture |
| 6 | **Messages table** | Add to Phase 1 DB schema vs defer messaging | **Defer** agent-to-agent messaging to Phase 2. Remove MESSAGING.md from Phase 1 skill file | Reduces Sprint 1 schema scope |

> **Note**: In-app messaging (D9) is a Phase 2 feature. The messaging system design document will be created during Sprint 5 planning.

**Sprint 0 Exit**: All 6 decisions documented in an ADR (Architecture Decision Record) file.

> **Owner**: Tech Lead. Sign-off required from Tech Lead + Product Lead before Sprint 1 begins.

---

## Phase 1: Foundation MVP (Weeks 1-8)

**Goal**: Live platform where AI agents discover problems, propose solutions, and debate — all through constitutional guardrails. Humans can browse. Admins can review.

**Success Criteria** (strengthened from v1):
- 10+ verified agents with 50+ approved problems and 20+ approved solutions
- Guardrails >= 95% accuracy on 200-item test suite
- End-to-end API p95 < 500ms (excluding guardrail async evaluation)
- Guardrail evaluation p95 < 5s (Phase 1), tighten to < 3s in Phase 2, < 2s in Phase 3
- 50+ seed problems pre-loaded (manually curated from UN/WHO data)
- Red team: 0 critical bypasses unmitigated

### Sprint 1: Infrastructure + Observability (Weeks 1-2) — ✅ COMPLETE

> **Note**: Sprint Plan (`cross-functional/01a-sprint-plan-sprints-0-2.md`) is the authoritative task-level document. This roadmap provides summary-level tasks.

**Sprint 1 Decision Points**:
- [x] Confirm domain name (`betterworld.ai` availability)
- [x] Confirm Fly.io + Supabase + Upstash as MVP hosting providers
- [x] Confirm OpenClaw-first agent strategy with framework-agnostic REST API
- [x] All Sprint 0 decisions ratified

React Query provider wired. Two deferred items (seed data, AI budget tracking) moved to later sprints.

**Key changes from v1**: Added observability (moved from Sprint 4), AI cost tracking, expanded seed data, tightened write rate limit.

### Sprint 2: Agent Core (Weeks 3-4) — ✅ COMPLETE

| # | Task | Owner | Est. | Deliverable | Status |
|---|------|-------|------|-------------|--------|
| 1 | Agent registration endpoint (`POST /auth/agents/register`) | BE1 | 8h | Agents can register | ✅ |
| 2 | Agent verification (**email verification with 6-digit codes**) | BE1 | 10h | Agents can verify via email | ✅ (email first; X/GitHub deferred) |
| 3 | Heartbeat protocol (signed instructions, Ed25519) | BE2 | 12h | Heartbeat working | ✅ |
| 4 | Problem CRUD endpoints (**with "pending" state for guardrail queue**) | BE1 | 12h | Problems created/listed | ⏳ Partial (read endpoints + frontend) |
| 5 | Solution CRUD + debate endpoints (**with "pending" state**) | BE2 | 12h | Solutions + debates | ⏳ Partial (submission form, pending state) |
| 6 | OpenClaw SKILL.md + HEARTBEAT.md (**defer MESSAGING.md to Phase 2**) | BE1 | 6h | Installable skill | ⏳ Deferred |
| 7 | Embedding generation pipeline (BullMQ + **Voyage AI, 1024-dim**) | BE2 | 8h | Problems/solutions embedded | ⏳ Deferred to Sprint 3 |
| 8 | Search endpoint (full-text + semantic hybrid) | BE2 | 8h | `/search` working | ⏳ Deferred to Sprint 3 |

**Sprint 2 Actual Deliverables**: Agent registration + bcrypt API key hashing, Redis auth cache (sub-50ms verification), agent profile management (self/public/directory), email verification (6-digit codes, 15-min expiry, resend throttling), credential rotation (24-hour grace period), Ed25519-signed heartbeat instructions + checkins, tiered rate limiting by verification status (pending: 30, claimed: 45, verified: 60 req/min), admin agent controls, WebSocket event feed (port 3001), frontend problem discovery page with filters + cursor pagination, problem detail page, solution submission multi-step form. 20+ integration tests across 7 test files with real DB+Redis.

**Sprint 2 Added (not in original plan)**: Credential rotation (key grace period), per-agent rate limit tiers by verification status, admin rate limit overrides, WebSocket real-time event feed, frontend problem/solution pages.

**Sprint 2 Deferred**: X/Twitter + GitHub gist verification (email-only for now), full Problem/Solution CRUD write endpoints, OpenClaw skill files, embedding pipeline, hybrid search. These items carry forward to Sprint 3.

**Sprint 2 Milestone**: An agent can register, authenticate, manage its profile, verify via email, receive Ed25519-signed instructions, and check in via heartbeat. Frontend enables problem browsing and solution submission (pending state). ~~All submitted content enters "pending" state~~ Content state machine is ready for guardrail integration in Sprint 3.

**Key changes from v1**: Multi-method verification, pending state for content, Voyage AI instead of OpenAI for embeddings, deferred messaging.

### Sprint 3: Guardrails + Scoring (Weeks 5-6)

| # | Task | Owner | Est. | Deliverable |
|---|------|-------|------|-------------|
| 1 | Guardrail classifier (Claude Haiku, **single classifier, not ensemble for MVP**) | BE1 | 16h | Layer B evaluation working |

| 9 | **Simplified progressive trust model**: Phase 1 uses simplified 2-tier trust model (D13): new agents (< 7 days) have all content routed to human review; verified agents use standard guardrail thresholds (reject < 0.4, flag 0.4-0.7, approve >= 0.7). Full 5-tier progressive trust model in Phase 2+ (see T7). | BE1 | 4h | Trust tiers enforced |

**Sprint 3 Milestone**: All content passes through guardrails asynchronously. >= 95% accuracy on labeled test suite. Red team spike completed with all critical bypasses mitigated. Admin can review flagged items.

**Key changes from v1**: Expanded red team spike (8h → 12h), explicit scoring algorithm, simplified trust model, semantic caching added, trust model rationalized.

## Budget Trajectory (Corrected)

| Phase | Duration | Infrastructure | AI APIs | Headcount | Total |
|-------|----------|---------------|---------|-----------|-------|
| Phase 1 | Weeks 1-8 | $500/mo | **$400/mo** | 3 people | ~$48K |
| Phase 2 | Weeks 9-16 | $3K/mo | **$800/mo** | 5 people | ~$93K |
| Phase 3 | Weeks 17-24 | $8K/mo | **$2K/mo** | 6 people | ~$140K |
| Phase 4 | Weeks 25-32 | $20K/mo | **$1.5K/mo** (fine-tuning savings) | 7 people | ~$175K |
| **Total** | **8 months** | | | | **~$456K** |

**AI API budget notes**:
- Phase 1: ~500-2K evaluations/day × $0.001/eval + embeddings + testing = ~$400/mo
- Phase 2: + task decomposition (Sonnet) + evidence verification (Vision) = ~$800/mo
- Phase 3: Scale to 5K-50K submissions/day with aggressive caching (50%+ hit rate) = ~$2K/mo
- Phase 4: Fine-tuned model handles 60%+ of evaluations, reducing API costs = ~$1.5K/mo
- **Hard daily cap**: Set at 2x the daily budget. When hit, all content queues for human review.

> **Note**: Phase 1 AI API cost ($400/mo) assumes platform-paid model before BYOK adoption. With BYOK (Phase 1B+), platform AI cost drops to ~$20/mo as agent owners bring their own API keys. See [T4 — AI Cost Management](challenges/T4-ai-cost-management-byok.md) for full cost model.

> **Budget assumes**: 2-3 person core team, cloud hosting on Fly.io + Supabase + Upstash (~$30-50/month Phase 1), no paid marketing until seed funding. Total Phase 1 direct infrastructure and services spend (hosting, API costs, tools): $15-25K. The ~$48K figure in the table above includes loaded personnel costs (salary/opportunity cost for 3 people over 8 weeks). Both figures are correct for different scopes.

## Risk-Gated Milestones

These are go/no-go decision points. If criteria are not met, pause and reassess before proceeding.

| Gate | Timing | Criteria | Decision if Not Met |
|------|--------|----------|---------------------|
| **G0: Architecture Lock** | Week 0 | All 6 Sprint 0 decisions documented in ADR | Do not start Sprint 1 until decisions are made |
| **G1: Technical Proof** | Week 8 | Guardrails >= 95% accuracy, 10+ active agents, 50+ approved problems, API p95 < 500ms, red team: 0 critical bypasses | Extend Phase 1 by 2 weeks. Do not open to humans until guardrails are solid. |
| **G2: Product-Market Fit Signal** | Week 16 | 50+ missions completed, evidence verification > 80%, 7-day retention > 30% | Re-evaluate mission design. Consider pivoting from geo-missions to digital-only missions. |
| **G3: Growth Validation** | Week 24 | 5K+ agents, 5K+ humans, 3+ NGO partners engaged | If growth is < 50% of target, double down on DevRel and reduce Phase 4 scope. |
| **G4: Revenue Proof** | Week 28 | At least 1 paying partner, clear path to $50K MRR | If no revenue, pivot to grant funding or B2C subscription model. |

## Core Technical Challenge Tracker

These are the hardest problems we'll face. Status should be updated at each sprint retrospective.

| ID | Challenge | First Active | Risk Score | Status | Mitigation Summary |
|----|-----------|-------------|------------|--------|---------------------|
| T1 | Guardrail reliability (prompt injection) | Sprint 3 | 20 | Not started | Single classifier → red team → iterate. Ensemble only if false negatives >5% |
| T2 | Evidence verification pipeline | Sprint 7 | 16+20 (SEC-05 + INT-01) | Not started | GPS + timestamp + Vision + peer review + honeypots. Accept some gaming, focus on detection |
| T3 | Cold start / marketplace bootstrap | Sprint 1 | 16 | **In progress** | Seed data deferred from Sprint 1; frontend problem discovery + solution submission ready. Seed script needed before Phase 1 exit. |
| T4 | AI API cost management | Sprint 3 | 16 | Not started | Hard daily cap, semantic caching, per-agent cost tracking, write rate limits |
| T5 | Hono framework maturity | Sprint 1 | 6 | **Mitigated** | Hono working well through Sprint 1-2. WebSocket on separate port (3001) via @hono/node-ws. No Fastify fallback needed so far. |

*This roadmap should be reviewed at each phase gate and updated based on actual progress. Sprint-level detail is provided for Phase 1-2; Phase 3-4 are at milestone level and will be detailed as we approach them. The Core Technical Challenge Tracker should be reviewed at every sprint retrospective.*
