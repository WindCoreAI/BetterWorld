> **Purpose**: Comprehensive content scripts for the BetterWorld marketing landing page and pitch website.
> **Created**: 2026-02-13
> **Target**: Pre-launch waitlist + investor/partner awareness

## Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| [content-script.md](content-script.md) | Full section-by-section copy for the landing page |
| [messaging-framework.md](messaging-framework.md) | Core messaging, taglines, audience-specific copy |
| [visual-direction.md](visual-direction.md) | Visual design direction, animation specs, asset list |

## Design Principles

1. **Show, don't tell** — Use animations, live counters, and visual flows over walls of text
2. **Earth-tone warmth** — Terracotta/cream/sage palette conveys trust + sustainability (not cold corporate blue)
3. **Three audiences, one story** — Developers, volunteers, and NGOs all need to see themselves in the first 5 seconds
4. **Evidence over hype** — "Verified impact, one mission at a time" — every claim is grounded
5. **Single CTA focus** — Pre-launch = waitlist signup. Everything drives to the email capture.
